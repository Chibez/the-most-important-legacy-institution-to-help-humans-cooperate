Interactive Guide on the Truth and Facts of Building the Most Important Legacy Institution to Help Humans Cooperate


Imagine that you are a participant in a social experiment. As you sit down, you are told that you will be playing a game with another person in a separate room. The other participant is also part of the experiment but the two of you will never meet. In the experiment, there is the possibility that you will be awarded some money. Both you and your unknown partner are required to make a choice: either choose to “cooperate,” maximizing your combined reward, or “defect,” (not cooperate) and thereby maximize your individual reward. The choice you make, along with that of the other participant, will result in one of three unique outcomes; If you and your partner both cooperate (1), you will each receive $10. If you and your partner both defect (2), you will each receive $4. However, if one partner defects and the other partner cooperates (3), the defector will receive $16, while the cooperator will receive nothing. Remember, you and your partner cannot discuss your strategy. Which would you choose? Striking out on your own promises big rewards but you could also lose everything. Cooperating, on the other hand, offers the best benefit for the most people but requires a high level of trust.
The realization that early humans were the hunted and not hunters have upended traditional ideas about what it takes for a species to thrive. For decades the reigning view had been that hunting prowess and the ability to vanquish competitors was the key to our ancestors' evolutionary success. Being hunted brought evolutionary pressure on our ancestors to cooperate and live in cohesive groups. That, more than aggression and warfare, is our evolutionary legacy. Consequently, the evolution of natural language as observed did not just occur suddenly or authoritatively. It took time for human to get acquitted and used to it through interactions between many players in the game through their actions and inactions. To illustrate this point, Leonard Read traces back a pencil’s development process, from tree through production line to coloring to final product. While no one person knows how to make a pencil and most of the thousands of people involved in producing it don’t know of each other, live in different countries, speak different languages, they nevertheless cooperate to produce a pencil, one of the thousands of items we take for granted in our lives.

Naturally Inclined to Cooperate

Some evidence points to humans being innately cooperative. Studies show that in the first year of life, infants exhibit empathy toward others in distress. At later stages in life we routinely work together to reach goals and help out in times of need.
Yet instances of selfish behavior also abound in society. One recent study used a version of the classic Prisoner's Dilemma, which can test people's willingness to set aside selfish interests to reach a greater good. After modeling different strategies and outcomes, the researchers found that being selfish was more advantageous than cooperating. The benefit may be short-lived, however. Another study showed that players who cooperated did better in the long run.
It seems that human nature supports both prosocial and selfish traits. Genetic studies have made some progress toward identifying their biological roots. By comparing identical twins, who share nearly 100 percent of their genes, and fraternal twins, who share about half, researchers have found overwhelming evidence for genetic effects on behaviors such as sharing and empathy. In these twin studies, identical and fraternal twins are placed in hypothetical scenarios and asked, for example, to split a sum of money with a peer. Such studies often also rely on careful psychological assessments and DNA analysis.
Other work highlights specific genes as key players. My colleagues and I recently identified a gene linked to altruistic behavior and found that a particular variant of it was associated with more selfish behavior in preschoolers.
As for how we might have acquired a genetic blueprint for collaboration, evolutionary scientists offer several explanations. Cooperative behavior may have evolved first among relatives to promote the continuation of their genetic line. As communities diversified, such mutual support could have broadened to include individuals not linked by blood. Another possibility is that humans cooperate to gain some advantage, such as a boost in reputation. Finally, a hotly debated idea is that evolutionary processes take place at the group level. Groups of highly cooperative individuals have higher chances of survival because they can work together to reach goals that are unattainable to less cooperative groups.
Yet almost no behavior is entirely genetic, even among identical twins. Culture, school and parenting are important determinants of cooperation. Thus, the degree to which we act cooperatively or selfishly is unique to each individual and hinges on a variety of genetic and environmental influences.
These ideas can improve and guaranty a world of cooperation.

Build and Value Trust

Trust is an essential prerogative to fill the world with human-focused organizations. After all, human relationships are based on trust, and can only work if it is maintained between two or more people. It is, therefore, no surprise that, in business, high levels of trust can create high-performance environments. This is what happens in human-centric companies.
From senior leaders being honest and taking responsibility to open and transparent communication, human-focused businesses are places where trust is valued and helps to build effective human relationships.
 
Ensure Quality Human-To-Human Interactions

Research shows that current performance management systems are not fit for purpose, as they use an instrumental and reductionist approach to support and encourage employees. In turn, this has a negative impact on the company’s performance.
Instead, leaders and managers should focus on providing their staff with an expert balance of challenge and support. Expert challenge is the process of helping people identify certain goals they need to achieve. Expert support, on the other hand, is the process of giving them the platform to actually achieve those targets.
Of course, this is no easy task. However, quality human-to-human exchanges can allow employees to flourish, and so will the managers and the company on the whole.

Talk To People

You’re probably saying “Meetings are a big part of our organization – of course people are talking!” Let’s start by clarifying that meetings are a whole other beast on their own… but aside from them, I cannot get over the times I walk through offices where people completely ignore others they pass by in the hallways. It’s as if I’ve shocked them when I smile and say “hi”. Anyone can start changing this. Smile, introduce yourself if you don’t know them yet, ask people how their weekend was. Please, just talk to people.

Scrap Your Vision and Values

I’m not saying to scrap strategy altogether, but so many organizations have generic values that should really be the basic cost of entry, and a vision of becoming “the biggest (best) most profitable widget maker in the world”. Inspiring, huh? Other than profit, what’s the purpose of your organization? If you focus on purpose and align people with passion, you just might get the profitability you’re hoping for. Consider why your organization exists, and how it makes a difference to people. Make these your strategic focus and engage people in how they contribute.

When It Comes To Policies, Less Is More

Review your existing policies. Are they truly needed? Can they be simplified? Are they written in human language? Stop writing policies for the exception. If someone does something that is a risk to the company or should be known to be wrong, manage their performance. Every mishap doesn’t mean a policy is needed.

Practice Empathy

In a recent study by DDI, empathy was found to be the most effective driver of performance, yet only 40% of leaders were found to be skilled at listening and responding with empathy. When I think of humanity, empathy is one of the pieces that stands out to me. People have lives outside of work, and when their child is sick (dog dies/parent needs care/marriage is failing), it will affect their work life. Be human about it. 
The world will be a better place if these values are incorporated in every institution
